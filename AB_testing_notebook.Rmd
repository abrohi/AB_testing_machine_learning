## Background

A/B testing is used in many companies, as it enables us to determine whether changes can lead to an improvement in conversion rate, hits or whatever the evualation metric is. A/B testing puts the customer first, it is a customer focused approach. 

A major issue with traditional, statistical-inference approaches to A/B Testing is that it only compares 2 variables - an experiment/control to an outcome. The problem is that customer behavior is vastly more complex than this. Also, traditional A/B test is a binary outcome (tests whether one group differs the other), it does not measure the effect. 

This is where Machine Learning excels, generating insights from complex systems.
